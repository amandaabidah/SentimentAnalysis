# SentimentAnalysis
This is the project I had with my friend as our final project for Exploratory Data Analysis course.
We did a twitter sentiment analysis towards one of the candidat for the Indonesian 2024 president election which is Prabowo.
Due to the limited free access towards Twitter API, we're using snscrape to collect out Twitter data using the keyword "Prabowo"
As for the sentiment analysis, we're using Lexicon based analysis which support Bahasa with weight ranging of positive and negative word from -5 to +5.

How To Use:
  1. The data set is available in this repository file.
  2. Download the "lexicon_positive" and "lexicon_negative" which contain the sentiment key words and upload it to the EDAProject_SentimentAnalysis.ipynb
  3. Run the code
